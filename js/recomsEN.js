			recomdescr: ["Over the past two years, I have worked intensively with Markus. Initially as an analyst and DEVOPS engineer while he maintained the existing User Access application and shortly later for while he helped design and build the new application. At that time, I noticed that Markus has a funny side and a very serious side. Merry upon entry and when he finds that the tension becomes too high within the team. Seriously if there are problems or if their backs should be put into the tasks ahead.","Secondly, we noticed that Markus is a born leader. After a few months, we asked whether he wanted to become a scrummaster. At that point, Marcus clearly showed that he can take on additional responsibility. He was clearly in the lead he manages his team members to ensure that the assignments are completed with high quality. Secondly, temporarily as a Product Owner. In this job not only a few team members were involved but multiple teams and alignment with various stakeholders. It was not entirely plain sailing, that was not entirely unexpected, considering the amount of pressure on the project.","Altogether, I think Markus is an allrounder, who, as I wrote above, can be deployed in many different areas. Markus is not only a hard worker but also a nice person and he can serve as a critical sounding board for complex issues."]

He's the kind of guy who can crack a joke in hard times, but still keeps on crunching work into the late hours to ensure the deadlines are met. "]

During this time he also made sure that I would develop a strong scripting mentality which has helped me a lot in many future assignments as well.", "In 2012 Markus decided to re-hire me for the adjustment and creation of multiple reports. This time I was working beside him as a \"Like minded\" colleague.", "Markus is a very fun, communicative, creative, technical and motivated person.
